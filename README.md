# hello-haskell
A functional example

## TLDR;
Use [Stack][1] to get GHC installed and build projects.

Get a code editor. I recommend [VS Code][2] or [Atom][3]. 

Use this repo as a guide but write your own code examples.

Start by reading hello-haskell (in this repo) or any beginning example.

The biggest step right now is to just _start_! 

Code your own example and keep coding.

## The Secret to Learning Stuff Really, Really Fast
If you want deep knowledge of something, teach it to someone else.

It'll force you to look at what you're doing from another perspective.

Seeing your world from other points of view is a transformative experience and will expand your mind.
